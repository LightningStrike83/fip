            <p>"On November 6, 2022, the NerveGear, a full dive virtual reality device, launched its first game; Sword Art Online. Its developer, Akihiko Kayaba told the 10,0000 players who logged in, they could not log out. And not only were they trapped, if a player died in-game, they would also die in the real world... This nightmare continued for what seemed like an eternity. Then, on November 7th, 2024, a heroic player dressed head-to-toe in black cleared the game and set everyone free."</p>

With so much at stake, and so many eyes upon him, he feels it necessary to stay strong and to silently bear any burden. A feeling I know all too well... For him, it has caused him to stop outwardly expressing his thoughts and feelings.
            I always believed him to be simply a gifted person who had never faced a day of hardship. How wrong I was..."</p>
