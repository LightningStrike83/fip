            <p>"On November 6, 2022, the NerveGear, a full dive virtual reality device, launched its first game; Sword Art Online. Its developer, Akihiko Kayaba told the 10,0000 players who logged in, they could not log out. And not only were they trapped, if a player died in-game, they would also die in the real world... This nightmare continued for what seemed like an eternity. Then, on November 7th, 2024, a heroic player dressed head-to-toe in black cleared the game and set everyone free."</p>>

            <p>"When I finally got around to asking why he's so quiet all the time, I could tell it was difficult for him to say. But he did. With so much at stake, and so many eyes upon him, he feels it necessary to stay strong and to silently bear any burden. A feeling I know all too well... For him, it has caused him to stop outwardly expressing his thoughts and feelings.
            I always believed him to be simply a gifted person who had never faced a day of hardship. How wrong I was..."</p>
